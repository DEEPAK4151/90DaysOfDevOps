Docker is a powerful platform that enables developers and operations teams to build, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers. In modern DevOps workflows, Docker plays a crucial role by simplifying environment consistency, accelerating deployment cycles, and enhancing scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers, Docker ensures that software runs reliably across different computing environments, making continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) more efficient and error-free.
